# Reconstruction fidelity audit (`src/`)

`src/` is a **structure-faithful mirror** of the original (see CLAUDE.md "Leading
tenet"). This audit lists, per module, where the reconstruction **deviates** from the
original's structure — the reimplementation-leaning parts to keep labeled and, where
feasible, bring back toward 1:1. Each module's `.h` carries the detailed in-code
`RECONSTRUCTION FIDELITY` note; this is the index.

## Classification

- **Transcription** — 1:1 with the decompiled function (same control flow, same data).
  This is the target for all of `src/`.
- **Behavior-faithful reconstruction** — the original does **not** decompile (e.g.
  self-modifying overlay blitters); reconstructed from raw disasm + validated
  byte/plane-exact against the engine, but the original's *structure* is not preserved.
- **Reimplementation deviation** — an abstraction or merge introduced for the C port
  that the binary does not have. To be minimized / clearly labeled.

## Module audit

| Module | Fidelity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vec.c` / `op12.c` | Transcription | `vec_run` op0/op4/op12 decoders, transliterated from the decomp. |
| `video.c` | Transcription | planar VGA mode-set + map-mask blit (BGI `int 10h` mode set ported). |
| `sprite.c` | Transcription | `sprite_bank_load_transform` = `sprite_bank_relocate_frames` + `sprite_frame_transform`. |
| `sprite_anim.c` | Transcription | `sprite_prepare_frame` = the per-frame select in `prepare_sprite_frames`. The dead `ctrl&0x40` expansion path is reconstructed and kept, marked UNVALIDATED. |
| `sprite_blit.c` | **Behavior-faithful** | `sprite_blit_planar_vga` reconstructs `1cec:10e1`, which does not decompile (self-modifying, unrolled, jump-table). Models the GC/Seq map-mask + bit-mask RMW as a portable 4-plane memory op, **not** VGA-hardware port writes. Validated byte-exact. `sel!=0` + left-edge clip-carry preload ported but UNVALIDATED. |
| `bg_render.c` | **Behavior-faithful** | `bg_tile_run` / `bg_render_grid` reconstruct `restore_bg_tile_run`'s loop + the mode-01 BGI-overlay tile blitter (`1ab9:0aa0`), which does not decompile. Same memory-image-vs-hardware caveat as `sprite_blit`. Validated byte-exact (119/119 cells). |
| `bgi_overlay.c` | **Behavior-faithful** | `restore_bg_view` (`1000:80bc` → `1ab9:0d77`) and `render_player_view` (`1000:93b8` → `1ab9:1028` → `1ab9:0db0`) reconstruct the two BGI-overlay dispatch wrappers. `render_player_view` sub-handler 0 (full 4-plane GC Read-Map-Select + rep-movsw copy) is fully reconstructed; sub-handlers 3–6 (masked copy variants) are STUBBED and UNVALIDATED. **Key finding:** both functions are structural NOPs in the layer-A/B draw context (code-embedded view descriptors at `0x114b:0x74a0` / `0x751e` have `word[0]` / `word[0x0e]` > 1 → NOP guard fires; see `present_model.md` §5). The NOP path is exercised by the harness via a `nop_view` descriptor mirroring the code-embedded values. |
| `sprite_chain.c` | Transcription | `sprite_blit_object_list` (0e48) + `sprite_blit_clip` (0f50) + `sprite_blit_setup` (103d) reconstructed 1:1 from the clean decomp. `sprite_blit_build_desc` is a thin public wrapper. One documented residual deviation: `sprite_blit_setup` fills the descriptor rather than tail-calling `sprite_blit_planar_vga` (the composite invokes the blitter separately). Validated descriptor-exact (17/17). |
| `entity.c` | Mixed | Layer-C/A/B placement + `draw_p1/p2_sprite` are transcriptions of the `spawn_and_draw_level_entities` (`1000:2a78`) loops and the draw fns. `entity_blit_object` is a shared helper the engine doesn't have (the engine inlines/repeats the prepare→blit per call). `entity_draw_layer_a/_b` now mirror the engine's full 3-step draw sequence: **erase (`restore_bg_view`) → blit (`blit_sprite`) → save-under (`render_player_view`)** — both erase and save-under are STRUCTURALLY PRESENT, called via `nop_view`, and are effective NOPs (code-embedded views in the engine; see `bgi_overlay.c` entry). Composite unchanged: 54152/64000 (world-8 live page). See [rendering-pipeline.md](rendering-pipeline.md). |
| `main.c` | **Reimplementation deviation (CRT/startup)** | The original's `main` and ~60 CRT-garble startup functions (TC++ CRT0, `__cstart`, etc.) are NOT reproduced — they are not decompilable and are not meaningful. This reconstruction uses the Open Watcom CRT with a standard `main`. `init_game_session_state` (1000:0282) is STUBBED: only `video_set_mode_0d()` is called (the structurally mandatory minimum for Task 3); keyboard ISR, joystick, resource table setup, and ~50 global resets are deferred to later tasks. `run_game_session` (1000:0258) is STUBBED (returns immediately). FUN_1000_31de (called from `reset_game_state`, Ghidra decompile failed) is noted as UNCERTAIN and not called from main. |

## Host/validation tooling (not part of the decompilation)

These are reimplementation/validation artifacts — the *Devilution-X*-flavored side — kept
clearly separate from the documentary `src/` mirror:

- `tools/composite_ctest.c` — models a **4-plane memory image** and the a000/a200
  double-buffer to validate the entity composite plane-exact. It is **not** how the
  engine renders (no BGI overlay, no VGA ports, no real page-flip); it's a differential
  oracle harness.
- `tools/sprite_oracle.py` — boots the real binary under Unicorn to capture engine ground
  truth (FRM3/FRM4); pure instrumentation.
- The various `*_ctest.c` host replays + `validate_*.sh` — differential validation only.

## Known open items (toward stricter fidelity)

1. **Blitters**: the two behavior-faithful blitters are the best achievable for
   non-decompiling self-modifying overlay code; keep the disasm-grounded reconstruction +
   document that the structure is intentionally not preserved.
2. **`bgi_overlay.c` sub-handlers 3–6**: the masked copy variants (`1ab9:0ecc`–`0e3c`) are
   STUBBED.  They are not triggered by any oracle-captured path (fullscreen_buf and
   layer-A/B NOP; sub-handler 0 is the only active path seen in the oracle).  Reconstruct
   when a call site that exercises them is identified.
3. **`restore_bg_view` inner blit**: the outer dispatch wrapper is reconstructed; the inner
   `1ab9:0aa0` bg-tile blitter is NOT separately exposed from `bg_render.c` — it is covered
   there as `bg_tile_run`.  Structural consolidation may be desirable for completeness.
